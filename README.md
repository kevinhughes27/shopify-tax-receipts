Tax Receipts
============

Shopify App for automatically sending customers tax receipts for specified products

[I built this app](https://www.kevinhughes.ca/blog/building-my-first-shopify-app) in my first ever company hackathon shortly after joining Shopify in 2013 to dog food our API and App developer experience. I went on to operate the app for over 10 years during which a fair number of recognizable charities adopted it in their organizations. The app had a 4.9 out 5 star rating in the Shopify App Store with numerous reviews praising the support I provided. Over the years some features were built in collaboration with charities who needed additional features including one charity that I helped self-host a version of the app. Another charity worked with students from Ã‰TS Montreal to contribute a new feature and I worked with the students to guide them through the process.

The app was quite low maintenance for a long time but eventually its age started to show and the time and effort to keep it working with upstream changes in Shopify became too great. In 2023 I started working with several app developers to provide a replacement option and in 2024 I finished shutting down this application.
